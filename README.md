# TramMeNow

This is a sample project demonstrating some basic UI elements and networking.  

The idea behind the app was to be as simple as possible.  I don't like having to type in what tram/bus stations I will be travelling from and to just to find out when the next tram/bus will be arriving at a location I already know. 
When leaving the office there is a tram stop outside the front door.  It's the closest one to me and sometimes I just want to know how many minutes I have until a tram/bus will arrive.  This app is for the lazy commuters with consistent travelling routes!

First the app will show you your current location, find out the closest tram/bus stop to your current location.  A call to the transport API will then return the next few trams/busses that are leaving that destination.  By clicking on a tram or bus in the list it will show you the stations it will be passing through as well as the arrival time at that station.

Future Updates:

- Allow people to specify how many tram/bus stops the app should look for around your current location
- Specify how many trams/busses should be returned by the API
- Localize the app for different languages
- Add common routes that you take with push notification alerts for when your usual tram and bus will be arriving/departing
- Better UI design
